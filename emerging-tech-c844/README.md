## 📂 Project Contents

### 🔎 [Task 1 – Network Vulnerability Assessment](./task-1-network-assessment.md)
Performed a host discovery and service enumeration scan using Nmap. Analyzed packet captures in Wireshark to identify potential vulnerabilities in protocols such as FTP, LDAP, and HTTP. Provided actionable recommendations to mitigate discovered risks.

### 📱 [Task 2 – WLAN & Mobile Security Plan](./task-2-wlan-mobile-plan.md)
Developed a comprehensive policy plan to protect wireless networks and mobile devices in an enterprise setting. Addressed WLAN and BYOD risks, proposed MDM and encryption controls (WPA3, VPN), and aligned with NIST and CISA cybersecurity frameworks.
