# 🖼️ Images – C844 Task 1: Network Vulnerability Assessment

This folder contains supporting screenshots and visual data for **Task 1** of the WGU C844 course: *Emerging Technologies in Cybersecurity*.

## 📌 Purpose

These images serve as visual documentation for the network scanning and traffic analysis processes performed using **Nmap (Zenmap)** and **Wireshark**.

They are referenced in the main report to validate:
- Network topology
- Detected vulnerabilities
- Protocol weaknesses
- Observed network anomalies
