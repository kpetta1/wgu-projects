## 🧠 Objective
Use the Iceberg Tool and Behavior Over Time (BOT) graphs to analyze the systemic issues facing Wilde’s Bramble, a fictional organic food startup experiencing rapid growth and financial instability.

---

## 🔍 Summary of Key Events
- Wilde’s Bramble expands after success in local markets
- Rapid growth leads to overextension via leased farmland
- Debt accrues through credit card use and mortgages
- Calla, one of the founders, takes an external job to help cash flow

## 🧊 Iceberg Model Breakdown

### **Visible (Events):**

### **Underlying Structures:**
- Reactive management decisions
- Financial overreach without planning

### **Mental Models:**
- High entrepreneurial risk tolerance
- Lack of financial forecasting and sustainability mindset

## 📈 Behavior Over Time (BOT) Graph Summary
- Initial rise in success followed by a steep increase in debt
- External income attempts to stabilize cash flow
- Graphs illustrate volatility caused by lack of long-term financial strategy

---

## 📊 Analysis
This scenario illustrates how surface-level events (e.g., expansion and debt) are symptoms of deeper issues: reactive planning and structural overdependence on credit. The Iceberg Tool reveals a business model in need of long-term thinking, cash flow forecasting, and sustainable expansion practices.

## ✅ Insights & Takeaways
- Systems thinking reveals how short-term decisions compound into long-term challenges
