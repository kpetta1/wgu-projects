# 🏘 Task 2 – Systems Archetype: Homelessness in Middlesex County

**Course:** D372 – Systems Thinking  
**Author:** Kiarah Pettaway

---

## 🧠 Objective
Apply a systems archetype to a real-world issue and explain how short-term solutions can reinforce systemic failure. This task focuses on homelessness in Middlesex County, Minnesota, and demonstrates the "Fixes That Fail" archetype.

---

## 🧩 Archetype Selected: **Fixes That Fail**

### 🔁 Reinforcing Loop:
- Reliance on short-term shelters appears to help, but fuels a cycle of dependency.
- Increased shelter use creates the illusion that the homelessness crisis is being solved.

### ⚖️ Balancing Loop:
- Perceived improvement reduces public pressure and funding for permanent housing solutions.
- Without long-term investment, root causes (housing costs, systemic inequality) are left unaddressed.

---

## 📉 Systemic Impact
This archetype illustrates how temporary fixes like emergency shelters can:
- Diminish urgency for reform
- Reduce funding for systemic housing initiatives
- Allow the core problem to grow beneath the surface

---

## 💡 Proposed Insight
Breaking the cycle requires:
- Long-term investment in affordable housing
- Public education on root causes of homelessness
- Policy shifts that focus on permanent, rather than reactive, solutions

---

## 🧠 Takeaways
- Systems archetypes like "Fixes That Fail" reveal how intentions can produce opposite effects
- Effective systems change requires addressing causes, not symptoms
