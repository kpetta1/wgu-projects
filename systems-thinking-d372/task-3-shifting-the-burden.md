**Course:** D372 – Systems Thinking  
**Author:** Kiarah Pettaway

## 🧠 Objective
Apply the “Shifting the Burden” systems archetype using WGU’s Four-Step Tool. Analyze a fictional business scenario and propose a long-term systems-based solution.

---

## 🏢 Case Overview
**Company:** Jaechap Advisors  
**Problem:** Internal debate on whether to adopt new data analytics software. While the current system works, leadership fears long-term competitiveness will suffer if they don’t evolve.

---

## 📊 Step 1: Iceberg Tool Summary
### Events (Visible):
- Jamal joins the company and becomes proficient in current tools
- Manager suggests new software; concerns arise about learning curve
- CEO urges modernization for competitiveness

### Patterns:
- Resistance to change
- Growing tension between efficiency and future-readiness

### Structures:
- Leadership emphasizes long-term value
- Teams fear short-term disruption

### Mental Models:
- Comfort in the status quo
- Skepticism toward new systems

---

## 📈 Step 2: Behavior Over Time (BOT)
- Organizational capability plateaus with current tools
- Jamal’s confidence and skill increase, but stalls without new tech
- Client expectations rise faster than internal capacity

---

## ♻️ Step 3: Archetype — Shifting the Burden
Jaechap avoids fundamental change (software upgrade) in favor of a short-term fix (keep current tools).
- **Symptomatic fix:** Rely on current software
- **Fundamental solution:** Train and transition team to modern platform

### Causal Loop Impact:
- Delay in upgrade reinforces fear of change
- Missed opportunity to meet future client demands

---

## 💡 Step 4: Proposed Solution
**Phased Implementation Plan:**
- Gradual rollout of new tools with training support
- Frame change as opportunity (not threat)
- Collect feedback and iterate rollout plan

### Strengths:
- Reduces disruption
- Builds internal buy-in
- Future-proofs company against client churn

### Challenges:
- Temporary dual-systems inefficiencies
- Potential lingering resistance

### Why It Wins:
- Outperforms “rip-the-bandage” or status quo models
- Balances people, performance, and progress
